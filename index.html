        <h2>What is NAT?</h2>
        <p>Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process used by firewalls and routers to modify the source or destination IP address of packets as they pass through. It enables private networks, which use internal IP addresses, to communicate with external networks like the internet.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How NAT Works</h2>
        <p>When a packet arrives at a firewall, the firewall checks its source and destination addresses. Based on the rules configured for NAT, the firewall may change these addresses. NAT works in conjunction with security policies, which allow or block packets based on predefined rules. While NAT changes the IP addresses, security policies are applied to ensure only authorized traffic passes through.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Types of NAT</h2>
        <p><strong>Source NAT:</strong> This type of NAT is used when traffic originates from inside a private network and is sent to the internet. It translates the private source IP to a public one so that external networks can recognize it.</p>
        <p><strong>Destination NAT:</strong> This is used for inbound traffic coming from the internet to a private network. The firewall translates the public destination IP to the correct private IP of the device within the network.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How Security Policies Interact with NAT</h2>
        <p>Firewalls evaluate packets based on <em>post-NAT zones</em>, which means they inspect the packets after the NAT process has been applied. Although NAT modifies IP addresses, security policies are enforced on the final zones that traffic is sent to, ensuring that only authorized communication is allowed.</p>
